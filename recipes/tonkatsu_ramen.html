    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons spicy sesame oil</li>
        <li>2 (1x3-inch) boneless pork chop slices</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon black sesame seeds, divided</li>
        <li>2 leaves fresh basil, chopped, divided</li>
        <li>1 leaf fresh sage, chopped, divided</li>
        <li>1 (3 ounce) package instant ramen noodles (such as Shirakiku®), seasoning packet discarded</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons shredded dried kombu</li>
        <li>1 ¾ tablespoons bonito soup stock (such as Hondashi®)</li>
        <li>1 ¾ tablespoons soy sauce (shoyu)</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon white miso paste with dashi</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Gently lower the egg into the boiling water and cook for 6 minutes.
            Drain the egg and immediately place it in a bowl of ice water to stop the cooking process. Once cooled, peel
            the egg and set it aside.</li>
        <li>In a shallow dish, combine the spicy sesame oil, pork chops, and 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Toss to coat the
            pork evenly. Marinate for 15 minutes or up to an hour.</li>
        <li>Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the marinated
            pork chops and cook for 3-4 minutes per side, or until cooked through. Sprinkle with half of the black
            sesame seeds.
        <li>Divide the ramen noodles into two serving bowls. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a medium saucepan, bring 4 cups of water to a boil. Add the dried kombu, bonito soup stock, soy sauce,
            and miso paste. Stir until the miso paste is dissolved. Bring to a simmer and cook for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Divide the hot broth evenly between the two serving bowls. Add the ramen noodles and cook for 1-2 minutes,
            or until softened.</li>
        <li>Top each bowl with the cooked pork chops, halved egg, chopped basil, chopped sage, and remaining black
            sesame seeds.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
